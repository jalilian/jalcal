Title: Convert Between Jalaali (Persian or Solar Hijri) and Gregorian Calendar Dates
Description: The Jalaali calendar, also known as the Persian or Solar Hijri 
    calendar, is the official calendar of Iran and Afghanistan. It starts on 
    Nowruz, the spring equinox, and follows an astronomical system for 
    determining leap years. Each year consists of 365 or 366 days, divided into 
    12 months. This package provides functions for converting dates between the 
    Jalaali and Gregorian calendars. The conversion calculations are based on 
    the work of Kazimierz M. Borkowski (1996) (<doi:10.1007/BF00055188>), who 
    used an analytical model of Earth's motion to compute equinoxes from AD 550 
    to 3800 and determine leap years based on Tehran time.
