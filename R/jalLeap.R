#' Determine Leap Year and First Day of Jalaali Year
#'
#' Based on the work by Kazimierz M. Borkowski (1996), this function determines
#' whether a given Jalaali (Persian) year is a leap year and calculates the
#' corresponding Gregorian year and the day in March when the Jalaali New Year
#' (Nowruz) begins.
#'
#' @param yearJ An integer representing the Jalaali (Persian) year.
#'
#' @details
#' The Jalaali calendar is a solar calendar with an irregular leap year cycle,
#' designed to align closely with the vernal equinox. Unlike the Gregorian
#' calendar, which follows a fixed leap year rule, the Jalaali leap years are
#' determined by a more complex astronomical system:
#'
#' - A typical cycle lasts 33 years, with leap years occurring in years that
#'   leave a remainder of 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 22, 26, or 30 when divided by 33.
#' - The cycle is occasionally disrupted by "break years," which adjust for
#'   small differences between the astronomical year and the calculated calendar.
#' - This function follows the leap year calculations and algorithm established by
#'   Kazimierz M. Borkowski (1996), who analysed equinox timings from AD 550 to
#'   3800.
#'
#' @return A named list with the following elements:
#' \item{leap}{An integer: 0 if the Jalaali year is a leap year and 1, 2 or 3
#' if the Jallai year is a common year.}
#' \item{GregorianYear}{The corresponding Gregorian year.}
#' \item{MarchDay}{The Gregorian calendar day in March when the Jalaali year starts.}
#'
#' @examples
#' # Check if 1403 is a leap year and get the start date of Nowruz
#' result <- jalLeap(1403)
#' print(result)
